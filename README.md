# Control Room Plus

A new version of the Django application with:
- Diary
- Personal Finance Manager
- Movies Collection
- TV Shows Collection

The application will be built in Next.js (Typescript) both the backend and the frontend.

Like the Django counterpart the user will be able to register and login to his personal page with access to his personal Diary, a personal Finance Manager that can help managing the expenses and incomes.
Plus there will be the usual pages to take a look at the Plex Media Library
